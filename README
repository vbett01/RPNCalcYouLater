Calcyoulater - Reverse Polish Notation Arithmetic
Author: Vincent Bett.

Purpose:
        To implement a Reverse Polish otation Calculator similar to the
        built in Unix dc calculator.

Files:
        DoubleStack.h
                Header file for the stack implementation
        DoubleStack.cpp
                The cpp file containing the code for the stack implementation
        RPNCalc.h
                Header file for the RPN calculator.
        RPNCalc.cpp
                Cpp file that launches the RPN calculator and performs
                calculations on user input or input from a file.
To Compile.
        clang++ -Wall -Wextra -g DoubleStack.cpp RPNCalc.cpp
Data structures used.
        I used a dynamic array to implement my stack class.
        Dynamic arrays are useful because they can grow or shrink
        depending on the data stored in them.
